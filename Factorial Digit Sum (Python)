#20 Project Euler
// Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

total = 1			  	# factorial must start at 1
for x in range(1,101):
	total *= x			# The math for the factorial of 100 or (100!)

digits = [int(str(total)[i]) for i in range(0,len(str(total)))]	  # "digits" stores a List of every digit of the number in total

print (sum(digits))		# prints the sum of each number in the List added (Answer = 648)
